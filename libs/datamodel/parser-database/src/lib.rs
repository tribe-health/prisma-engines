#![deny(unsafe_code, rust_2018_idioms, missing_docs)]

//! See the docs on [ParserDatabase](./struct.ParserDatabase.html).
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! The ParserDatabase is tasked with gathering information about the schema. It is _connector
//! agnostic_: it gathers information and performs generic validations, leaving connector-specific
//! validations to later phases in datamodel core.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! Names:
//!
//! - _mapped name_: the name inside an `@map()` or `@@map()` attribute of a model, field, enum or
//!   enum value. This is used to determine what the name of the Prisma schema item is in the
//!   database.
//! - _database name_: the name in the database, once both the name of the item and the mapped
//!   name have been taken into account. The logic is always the same: if a mapped name is defined,
//!   then the database name is the mapped name, otherwise it is the name of the item.
//! - _foreign key name_: the name inside the `map: ...` argument inside an `@relation()`
//!   attribute. This is taken as the database name of the constraint backing the relation, on the
//!   connectors where that makes sense.

/// ParserDatabase is a container for a Schema AST, together with information
/// gathered during schema validation. Each validation step enriches the
/// database with information that can be used to work with the schema, without
/// changing the AST. Instantiating with `ParserDatabase::new()` will perform a
/// number of validations and make sure the schema makes sense, but it cannot
/// fail. In case the schema is invalid, diagnostics will be created and the
/// resolved information will be incomplete.
///
/// Validations are carried out in the following order:
///
/// - The AST is walked a first time to resolve names: to each relevant
///   identifier, we attach an ID that can be used to reference the
///   corresponding item (model, enum, field, ...)
/// - The AST is walked a second time to resolve types. For each field and each
///   type alias, we look at the type identifier and resolve what it refers to.
/// - The AST is walked a third time to validate attributes on models and
///   fields.
/// - Global validations are then performed on the mostly validated schema.
///   Currently only index name collisions.
///
/// ## Lifetimes
///
/// Throughout the ParserDatabase implementation, you will see many lifetime
/// annotations. The only significant lifetime is the lifetime of the reference
/// to the AST contained in ParserDatabase, that we call by convention `'ast`.
/// Apart from that, everything should be owned or locally borrowed, to keep
/// lifetime management simple.
